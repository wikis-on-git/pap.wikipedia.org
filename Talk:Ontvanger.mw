This page has [[:d:Q65450132|Wikidata item Q65450132]]. It needs: 
* content (minimally including label and description in English)
* possible merge with an existing Wikidata item for the identical topic
When the above steps are carried out, interwiki links (i.e. to other WP language projects) will appear ''and'' it may be unnecessary to add any further content to the item. Let me know if I can help further. - [[User:Deborahjay|Deborahjay]] ([[User talk:Deborahjay|diskushon]]) 12:55, 18 yüni 2021 (UTC)
: It's the revenue service, or rather the role of the government when it acts as the recipient (òntfanger, ontvanger) of taxes due. The revenue service is the organisation responsible for collecting these taxes for the government, but the government is the one that the tax office does the collecting for, if I understand correctly. It's a subtle difference. I made a naive attempt to merge this item with {{Q|573607}} but that is (correctly, it seems) linked to [[Servisio di Impuesto]], literally the ''tax service''. There might be a Q-number that does apply, but it's not {{Q|2509483}}. That is about the revenue collected (through tax or otherwise). --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|diskushon]]) 19:35, 19 yüni 2021 (UTC)
