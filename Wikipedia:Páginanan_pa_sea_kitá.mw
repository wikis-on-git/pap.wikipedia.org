* [[Gospel Society & Leo Davelaar]] - New articles have to have at least one source. This article has none. [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|diskushon]]) 18:02, 21 yüli 2021 (UTC)
* [[Leo Davelaar]] - New articles have to have at least one source. This article has none. [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|diskushon]]) 18:04, 21 yüli 2021 (UTC)
*: This article has had an unfinished sentence in the education section for quite some time now, and indeed, sources are currently missing. I did however find some newspaper articles online related to the subject. I would prefer the original author ({{Ping|Clifford de Lannoy}}) add one or a few reference, so we can keep the article instead of having to remove it. Can we give it another two weeks perhaps? --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|diskushon]]) 11:00, 12 sèptèmber 2021 (UTC)
* [[Mohammad Mohammadian]] - interwiki spam, article parcially in foreign language. [[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]] ([[User talk:Caribiana|diskushon]]) 14:49, 10 sèptèmber 2021 (UTC)
*: If we remove the foreign language text not enough remains to really be of use, so I am in support of deleting this article. --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|diskushon]]) 10:56, 12 sèptèmber 2021 (UTC)
