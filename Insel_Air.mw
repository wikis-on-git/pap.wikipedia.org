[edit] History
Insel Air is a private initiative of various businesses and financial institutions who recognized the need and importance for a Curaçao based and owned airline to provide reliable quality sevice to regional destinations for a reasonable price. The airline started operations in August 2006 with one Embraer 110-P1 Bandeirante flying from Curaçao. The first flight was to the neighboring island of Aruba. Soon after the daily scheduled flights to Aruba, Insel Air started with flights to the other neighboring island of Bonaire. Since January 2007, Insel Air services the eastern and northern Caribbean islands through Sint Maarten with a MD-83 and since June 2008 also with a MD-82.

Insel Air uses Sita airline management system, Gabriel.
