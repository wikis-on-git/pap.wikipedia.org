== Reconcile spelling ==

The page name is '''[[Frances]]''', but in the infobox appears as '''[[Franses]]'''. Which is the preferred spelling for this WP? - [[User:Deborahjay|Deborahjay]] ([[User talk:Deborahjay|diskushon]]) 15:30, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)
: This answer may seem unhelpful but it is provided for context. The question you pose has come up in the past, and to be honest I don't recall the exact conclusion we came to. We did agree that it was okay for the titles of the fields in the infobox to be in Papiamentu (Curaçao variant) but I am not sure about the field's content. It could be argued either way. As the conversation took place off-wiki (in a Zoom conference this February) I can't point to it unfortunately. Perhaps [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] or [[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]] recalls the exact decision the group came to? --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|diskushon]]) 17:03, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)
::It was agreed by the moderators that both spelling versions are acceptable on WP, under condition that the version in which an article is started should be maintained throughout further edits. For infoboxes it was agreed that the field descriptions be limited to variante|c, but no restriction/exception was made for the field content. In the article history the article creator states that it was created in variante|c, although the title is in variante|a. Therefore I will proceed to correct and reconcile its spelling and title with this version. However, a dilemma arises from [[User:Deborahjay|Deborahjay]] remarks about the infobox; namely country templates in variante|c are used as field content. In the case this was a variante|a article how can this be reconciled? A matter for the moderators to ponder at the next meeting?

:::@[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]]: for WD we initially agreed to put the -u as label, and add the -o as alias since there only was a Papiamento-language possibility. But then pap-aw was turned added to Wikidata, so now both version can be added/used. Papiamentu is still the leading language for both Mediawiki and Wikidata: only when the pap-aw mentions a different spelling, it will overwrite (though this might be depending on the configuration of the wikidatadriven infoboxes? But that's more your department ;-).
:::: I have been pondering over this and I think the cleanest option will be to have an optional parameter 'variante' that can be added to infoboxes, so their fields can be switched to correspond to whatever variant the article was written in. That is not something that's already in place, will have to be added (over time). [[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|diskushon]]) 16:05, 14 yüni 2021 (UTC)
