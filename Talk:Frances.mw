== Reconcile spelling ==

The page name is '''[[Frances]]''', but in the infobox appears as '''[[Franses]]'''. Which is the preferred spelling for this WP? - [[User:Deborahjay|Deborahjay]] ([[User talk:Deborahjay|diskushon]]) 15:30, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)
: This answer may seem unhelpful but it is provided for context. The question you pose has come up in the past, and to be honest I don't recall the exact conclusion we came to. We did agree that it was okay for the titles of the fields in the infobox to be in Papiamentu (Cura√ßao variant) but I am not sure about the field's content. It could be argued either way. As the conversation took place off-wiki (in a Zoom conference this February) I can't point to it unfortunately. Perhaps [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] or [[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]] recalls the exact decision the group came to? --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|diskushon]]) 17:03, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)
