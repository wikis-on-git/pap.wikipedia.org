== Reconcile spelling ==

The page name is '''[[Frances]]''', but in the infobox appears as '''[[Franses]]'''. Which is the preferred spelling for this WP? - [[User:Deborahjay|Deborahjay]] ([[User talk:Deborahjay|diskushon]]) 15:30, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)
: This answer may seem unhelpful but it is provided for context. The question you pose has come up in the past, and to be honest I don't recall the exact conclusion we came to. We did agree that it was okay for the titles of the fields in the infobox to be in Papiamentu (Cura√ßao variant) but I am not sure about the field's content. It could be argued either way. As the conversation took place off-wiki (in a Zoom conference this February) I can't point to it unfortunately. Perhaps [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] or [[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]] recalls the exact decision the group came to? --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|diskushon]]) 17:03, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)
::It was agreed by the moderators that both spelling versions are acceptable on WP, under condition that the version in which an article is started should be maintained throughout further edits. For infoboxes it was agreed that the field descriptions be limited to variante|c, but no restriction/exception was made for the field content. In the article history the article creator states that it was created in variante|c, although the title is in variante|a. Therefore I will proceed to correct and reconcile its spelling and title with this version. However, a dilemma arises from [[User:Deborahjay|Deborahjay]] remarks about the infobox; namely country templates in variante|c are used as field content. In the case this was a variante|a article how can this be reconciled? A matter for the moderators to ponder at the next meeting?
