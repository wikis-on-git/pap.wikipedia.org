== Usage ==
The infobox may be added by pasting the template as shown below into an article and then filling in the desired fields. Any parameters left blank or omitted will not be displayed.

=== Blank template with basic parameters ===

== Parameters ==
Do not use all these parameters for any one person. The list is long to cover a wide range of people. Only use those parameters that convey essential or notable information about the subject, and ensure that that information is sourced in the article or (if present only in the infobox) in the infobox itself. Any parameters left blank or omitted will not be displayed. If a data field has more than one parameter name which can be used, the preferred name is listed first in '''bold''' print.

{| class="wikitable"
! style="text-align: left" | Parameter
! style="text-align: left" | Explanation
|-
| '''honorific_prefix'''
| To appear on the line above the person's name
|-
| '''name'''
| Common name of person (defaults to article name if left blank; provide '''birth_name''' (below) if different from '''name'''). If middle initials are specified (or implied) by the lead of the article, and are not specified separately in the '''birth_name''' field, include them here.
|-
| '''honorific_suffix'''
| To appear on the line below the person's name
|-

|-
| '''image_size'''<br /> (''imagesize'')

This parameter should not normally need to be set.
|-
| '''alt'''
| Alt text for image, for visually impaired readers. One word (such as "photograph") is rarely sufficient. See [[WP:ALT]].

|-
| '''baptised'''

|-
| '''disappeared_place'''

|-
| '''death_date'''
| Date of death: {{tl|death date and age}} (if birth date is known) or {{tl|death date}} (if birth date unknown). See [[Template:Death date/doc]] for details on usage. If exact dates are unknown, consider using {{tl|death year and age}}.

|-
