== Parameters ==
Do not use all these parameters for any one person. The list is long to cover a wide range of people. Only use those parameters that convey essential or notable information about the subject, and ensure that that information is sourced in the article or (if present only in the infobox) in the infobox itself. Any parameters left blank or omitted will not be displayed. If a data field has more than one parameter name which can be used, the preferred name is listed first in '''bold''' print.

{| class="wikitable"
! style="text-align: left" | Parameter
! style="text-align: left" | Explanation
|-
| '''honorific_prefix'''
| To appear on the line above the person's name
|-
| '''name'''
| Common name of person (defaults to article name if left blank; provide '''birth_name''' (below) if different from '''name'''). If middle initials are specified (or implied) by the lead of the article, and are not specified separately in the '''birth_name''' field, include them here.
|-
| '''honorific_suffix'''
| To appear on the line below the person's name
|-

|-
| '''image_size'''<br /> (''imagesize'')

This parameter should not normally need to be set.
|-
| '''alt'''
| Alt text for image, for visually impaired readers. One word (such as "photograph") is rarely sufficient. See [[WP:ALT]].

| Date of birth: {{tl|birth date and age}} (if living) or {{tl|birth date}} (if dead).  See [[Template:Birth date and age/doc]] for details on usage. If only a year of birth is known, or age as of a certain date, consider using {{tl|birth year and age}} or {{tl|birth based on age as of date}}.
|-
| '''birth_place'''

|-
| '''baptised'''

|-
| '''disappeared_place'''

|-
| '''death_date'''
| Date of death: {{tl|death date and age}} (if birth date is known) or {{tl|death date}} (if birth date unknown). See [[Template:Death date/doc]] for details on usage. If exact dates are unknown, consider using {{tl|death year and age}}.

Note: [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (icons)#Do not use flags to indicate locations of birth, residence, or death|Do not use a flag template]].

|-
| '''death_cause'''
| Cause of death.

|-
