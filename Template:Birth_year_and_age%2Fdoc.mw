===Usage===
The templates {{tl|Birth year and age}} and {{tl|Death year and age}} return a person's year of birth or death and his or her approximate age. The templates are useful when only the year, or year and month, of a person's birth and/or death are known, or if it is desired not to state a person's full dates of birth and death for privacy reasons.

Such an approximation differs from the approximation generated by  {{t1|Birth based on age as of date}}; the latter can be used when the only detail available about someone's birth is a reference that establishes his or her age as of a certain date (such as the date that the reference was published).

The examples on this page use the current date as<br> 
{{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}
|}

The person's age is estimated as follows:

====<nowiki>{{Birth year and age}}</nowiki>====
Let us assume:
#that the person in question was born some time in {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 55}}; and
#that the present date is {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}.

*If the person was born after {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 55}} then she will be {{age|{{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 55}}|{{CURRENTMONTH}}|{{#expr: {{CURRENTDAY}} + 1 }} }} years old on {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} as she has not had her 55th birthday yet. On the other hand, if she was born exactly on or before {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 55}}, then she will be 55 years old. 

::Therefore, the template {{tlx|Birth year and age|{{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 55}} }}
::displays her birth year and age as: {{birth year and age|{{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 55}}}}

*Optionally, if we know the person's birth month but not the day, we can also have the template display the month.

::Let us assume that the person was born in June {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 55}}. Therefore:
::*If it is presently January {{CURRENTYEAR}}, then this year the person has not had her birthday yet. Therefore, the template {{tlx|Birth year and age|{{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 55}}|6}} displays her birth year and age as: {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 55}} (age 54).
::*If it is presently June {{CURRENTYEAR}}, we do not know whether the person has had her birthday this year yet since her day of birth is unknown. Therefore, the template displays her birth year and age as: {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 55}} (age 54â€“55).
::*If it is presently December {{CURRENTYEAR}}, then this year the person has already had her birthday. Therefore, the template displays her birth year and age as: {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} - 55}} (age 55).
