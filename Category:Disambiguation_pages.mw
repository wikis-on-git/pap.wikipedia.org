'''Disambiguation''' in Wikipedia is the process of resolving the conflicts that occur when articles about two or more different topics could have the same "natural" page title. This category contains ''disambiguation pages'': non-article pages containing links to other Wikipedia articles and disambiguation pages.

Disambiguation pages are added to [[:Category:Disambiguation pages]] by placing the {{tl|Disambig}} template on the page itself. 

==Notes==
'''Do not include this category manually in articles; the {{tl|Disambig}} template automatically does this.'''
* Do not add articles to these sub-categories or create additional sub-categories until you read [[:en:Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Disambiguation pages|Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)]].
