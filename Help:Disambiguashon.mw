'''Disambiguation''' pages on Wikipedia are used as a process of resolving conflicts in article titles that occur when a single term can be associated with more than one topic, making that term likely to be the natural title for more than one article. In other words, disambiguations are paths leading to different articles which could, in principle, have the same title.

For example, the word "Mercury" can refer to several different things, including an element, a planet, and a Roman god. Since only one Wikipedia page can have the generic name "Mercury", ''unambiguous'' article titles are used for each of these topics: [[Mercury (element)]], [[Mercury (planet)]], [[Mercury (mythology)]]. There must then be a way to direct the reader to the correct specific article when the ambiguous word "Mercury" is referenced by linking, browsing or searching; this is what is known as ''disambiguation''. In this case it is achieved using [[Mercury]] as the title of a ''disambiguation page''.

There are three principal disambiguation scenarios, of which the following are examples:
* The page at '''[[Lago]]''' is a ''disambiguation page'', leading to all the alternative uses of "Lago". It has a {{tl|Disambig}} template at the bottom.
* The page at '''[[Tera]]''' is about one usage, called the ''primary topic'', and there is a short message at the top of the page, called a ''hatnote'' and created with the {{tl|See also}} template, guiding readers to '''[[Tera (desambiguashon)]]''' so other uses of the term can be found.

Occasionally a reader may follow a link that ends up at a disambiguation page rather than at one of the links shown on that page. The original page can be edited to link directly to its intended destination. Feel free to make such edits; everyone is welcome to improve Wikipedia, including you. It could be you who makes the overall experience of Wikipedia that much better.
