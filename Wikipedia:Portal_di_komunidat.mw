== Admin on the Papiamentu Wikipedia? ==
Hi,

Some people would like to 'revive' the Papiamentu Wikipedia, but there is some backlogged maintenance work that need to be done first. I've been an admin on the Dutch Wikipedia for 14 years and from that experience offer to help out, by doing some maintenance work but also by showing other new admins, that hopefully step forward soon, how the Mediawiki extensions work, how to keep a wiki clean, and how to build a community. 

For this it would be handy if I was granted admin rights on this wiki: it is in no way my intention to be admin for life, since I do not speak the language, but I am more than willing to help set up this new community. I'd like to apply for adminship on meta over ~10 days, if everyone is okay with this at least. Please let me know if you have any questions, either here or by email.

==Curaçao photos==
My apologies as I am not fluent in Papiamentu. I would just like to let people know there is a [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:History_of_Cura%C3%A7ao big collection] of images from Curaçao's history. ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:People_of_Cura%C3%A7ao Click here] for photos of people; there are some color photos from the 1960s as well.) Many of them are not used and I imagine many people interested in this Wikipedia would like to use them if they don't already know about them.

== Adjustments for this wiki ==
Hi,

I've put in a request for a patrolling marker, so we can check off patrolled edits (for instance in the recent changes). I need community support for this, so please let me know if you support this feature, either here below, or on [[phabricator:T268924]]. (You can log in and comment with your Wikimedia-account)

I would also like to propose to ask for a 'new section' tab to be added for talk pages and the Portal di komunidat. This tab is on the right, between 'edit' and history, so you don't have to edit the complete page if you want to create a new section (like [[:en:Wikipedia:Help_desk|here on en:]]). 
Please also for this speak your mind whether you would support such a change. 

(courtesy ping @[[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]], @[[User:YAniceta|YAniceta]], @[[User:Dwerg85|Dwerg85]])

Best, [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 10:17, 29 novèmber 2020 (UTC)
*I've created a public [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox-page]], feel free (please!) to translate the text to Papiamentu.
* It would be nice to fill [[Help:Kontenido]], since it is linked in the side-column. Any help is appreciated.
*I created the templates {{tl|See article}} and {{tl|See also}}, plus the page [[Help:Disambiguashon]] for explanation (feel free to translate, of course)
* For pages that need deletion, please use {{tl|Delete}}, and mention them on [[Wikipedia:Páginanan pa sea kitá]].

<br>

:These are all positive additions and improvements to the wiki. +1 support from me. --[[User:Dwerg85|Dwerg85]] ([[User talk:Dwerg85|talk]]) 23:01, 7 desèmber 2020 (UTC)
::Thanks Dwergje! Patrolling has been turned on this afternoon: you can now see the exclamation mark in the [[Special:RecentChanges|recent changes]], and a "mark as patrolled" button when you compare versions. On the Dutch Wikipedia we only use this for ip- or newbie edits, but off course this wiki can decide different. [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 21:00, 15 desèmber 2020 (UTC)

== Wikidata descriptions changes to be included more often in Recent Changes and Watchlist ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''Sorry for sending this message in English. Translations are available on [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Announcements/Announcement Wikidata descriptions in watchlist|this page]]. Feel free to translate it in more languages!''

As you may know, you can include changes coming from Wikidata in your Watchlist and Recent Changes ([[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-watchlist|in your preferences]]). Until now, this feature didn’t always include changes made on Wikidata descriptions due to the way Wikidata tracks the data used in a given article.

Starting on December 3rd, the Watchlist and Recent Changes will include changes on the descriptions of Wikidata Items that are used in the pages that you watch. This will only include descriptions in the language of your wiki to make sure that you’re only seeing changes that are relevant to your wiki.

This improvement was requested by many users from different projects. We hope that it can help you monitor the changes on Wikidata descriptions that affect your wiki and participate in the effort of improving the data quality on Wikidata for all Wikimedia wikis and beyond.

Note: if you didn’t use the Wikidata watchlist integration feature for a long time, feel free to give it another chance! The feature has been improved since the beginning and the content it displays is more precise and useful than at the beginning of the feature in 2015.

If you encounter any issue or want to provide feedback, feel free to use [[Phab:T191831|this Phabricator ticket]]. Thanks!

== Templates needed ==
Can someone give assistance to the Papiamento wikipedia community by creating for us the following templates: {{tl|commonscat}} and {{coor title dms}}? Your contribution is highly appreciated. Any questions please contact me. [[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]] ([[User talk:Caribiana|talk]]) 11:13, 25 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
:I planned for this week to check how far along we are with everything, so I'll add these two templates on my list! [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 20:52, 25 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
::Do we have a {{tl|welcome}} already? I see we were joined by several new users last week, it would be nice to be able to send them a welcome message, in Papiamentu off course! [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 20:59, 25 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
:::Thank you, Ciell! I will make an effort to create a welcome template. Still learning by trial and error!!! Today I tried to use this [[Template:Infobox stadion]], but it does not work. Under special pages there is a list of unused templates that perhaps also need reviewing.[[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]] ([[User talk:Caribiana|talk]]) 22:54, 25 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
::::More complicated templates, like infoboxes, need a background with [[:en:Lua (programming language)]] to make information visible - that looks like the case with this one. It may be better to find a simpler template on another wiki to copy the code from. If I recall correctly, also [[User:YAniceta|YAniceta]] does not know Lua, and I know very little people that can really work with this code. [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 06:39, 26 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
: I did a quick move of {{tl|Commonscat}} for you. Here is an example:
{{Commonscat|Example images}}

: Please check the language, I have a bit of an ''atraso lingwístiko'' in Papiamentu. There are some artistic choices to be made regarding the location of links to the sister projects, and these require Admin privileges as well. Coor title dms also requires some artistic choices and admin access. So I left that to Ciell. ;) --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|talk]]) 15:25, 27 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
::Hi [[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]], masha danki!. Great input for the Papiamentu wikipedia to keep moving ahead. I made a minor adjustment to the template text. Most appreciated was that the "template" is identical to the Dutch version. This saves energy and time when translating articles from NL to PAP. Saludos!! [[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]] ([[User talk:Caribiana|talk]]) 18:54, 28 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
::: You're welcome! I have also had a look at {{tl|Coor title dms}} but I was a bit overwhelmed with options. I think it might be better to start afresh instead of copying the dutch version, because that one is rather complicated. Also, could you perhaps help me translate the terms 'oosterlengte', 'westerlengte', 'noorderbreedte' and 'zuiderbreedte'? And finally: how would one write the following coordinate (that of Willemstad): "12° 6′ NB, 68° 56′ WL" is what is written in Dutch, how would you translate the NB and WL? Is the notation somehow different? I would expect not, but you never know... --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|talk]]) 21:35, 28 yanüari 2021 (UTC)

== Admin rights on this wiki ==

Hi all,

My admin rights will expire in three days, on the 20th of February. Luckily, [[User:Caribiana|Caribeana]] and [[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] are willing to step forward and take up adminship on this wiki: they both speak Papiamentu and have a background in writing wiki articles, or development. I think they would make a great team, as they do already for the maintenance of this wiki!

I'd like to keep my rights for another 3 month so I can show them the ropes and help solve new problems they may encounter. For this, I again need the communities' support. So for you the question:<br>
''Can I get your support for another three months as an admin here?''

Thanks! [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 11:05, 17 febrüari 2021 (UTC)
: '''Yes'''. I wholeheartedly support Ciells request for another three months. And indeed, I am willing to take on admin duties, if there are no objections. I am happy that Ciell wants to back us up as we familiarize ourselves with this new role (or at least, new to me). --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|talk]]) 11:41, 17 febrüari 2021 (UTC)
