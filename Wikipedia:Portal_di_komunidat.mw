The Wikimedia Foundation is planning a [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|global consultation about communication]]. The goal is to bring Wikimedians and wiki-minded people together to improve tools for communication.

We want all contributors to be able to talk to each other on the wikis, whatever their experience, their skills or their devices.

We are looking for input from as many different parts of the Wikimedia community as possible. It will come from multiple projects, in multiple languages, and with multiple perspectives.

We are currently planning the consultation. We need your help.

'''We need volunteers to help talk to their communities or user groups.'''

You can help by hosting a discussion at your wiki. Here's what to do:  
# First, [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Participant group sign-up|sign up your group here.]]  
# Next, create a page (or a section on a Village pump, or an e-mail thread – whatever is natural for your group) to collect information from other people in your group.  This is not a vote or decision-making discussion: we are just collecting feedback.  
# Then ask people what they think about communication processes.  We want to hear stories and other information about how people communicate with each other on and off wiki.  Please consider asking these five questions:
## When you want to discuss a topic with your community, what tools work for you, and what problems block you?
## What about talk pages works for newcomers, and what blocks them?
## What do others struggle with in your community about talk pages?
## What do you wish you could do on talk pages, but can't due to the technical limitations?
## What are the important aspects of a "wiki discussion"?
# Finally, please go to [[mw:Talk:Talk pages consultation 2019|Talk pages consultation 2019 on Mediawiki.org]] and report what you learned from your group.  Please include links if the discussion is available to the public.

'''You can also help build the list of the many different ways people talk to each other.'''

Not all groups active on wikis or around wikis use the same way to discuss things: it can happen on wiki, on social networks, through external tools... Tell us [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Tools in use|how your group communicates]].

You can read more about [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|the overall process]] on mediawiki.org. If you have questions or ideas, you can [[mw:Talk:Talk pages consultation 2019|leave feedback about the consultation process]] in the language you prefer.

Thank you! We're looking forward to talking with you.

</div></div>

Welcome back to the [[mw:Editing|Editing]] newsletter.

Since [[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2018/October|the last newsletter]], the team has released two new features for the [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|mobile visual editor]] and has started developing three more.  All of this work is part of the team's goal to [[m:Wikimedia Foundation Annual Plan/2018-2019/Audiences#Outcome 3: Mobile Contribution|make editing on mobile web simpler]].  

Before talking about the team's recent releases, we have a question for you:  

<strong>Are you willing to try a new way to add and change links?</strong>

If you are interested, we would value your input!  You can try this new link tool in the mobile visual editor on a separate wiki. 

<em>Follow these instructions and share your experience:</em>

<strong>[[mw:Topic:V394zwrigth8ii7c|📲 Try Edit Cards]].</strong>

=== Recent releases ===
The mobile visual editor is a simpler editing tool, for smartphones and tablets using the [[mw:Reading/Web/Mobile#About|mobile site]].  The Editing team recently launched two new features to improve the mobile visual editor: 

# [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Section editing|Section editing]]
#* The purpose is to help contributors focus on their edits.
#* The team studied this with an A/B test.  [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Section editing#16 June 2019|This test showed]] that contributors who could use section editing were '''1% more likely to publish''' the edits they started than people with only full-page editing.
# [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile#March 1, 2019|Loading overlay]]
#* The purpose is to smooth the transition between reading and editing.

Section editing and the new loading overlay are '''now available to everyone''' using the mobile visual editor.

=== New and active projects ===
This is a list of our most active projects. [[mw:Help:Watching pages|Watch]] these pages to learn about project updates and to share your input on new designs, prototypes and research findings.

*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Edit cards|Edit cards]]: This is a clearer way to add and edit links, citations, images, templates, etc. in articles.  You can try this feature now.  <em>Go here to see how:</em> [[mw:Topic:V394zwrigth8ii7c|📲 <em>Try Edit Cards</em>]].
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Toolbar refresh|Mobile toolbar refresh]]: This project will learn if contributors are more successful when the editing tools are easier to recognize.
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/VE mobile default|Mobile visual editor availability]]: This A/B test asks:  ''Are newer contributors more successful if they use the mobile visual editor?''  We are collaborating with [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/VE mobile default#26 June 2019 %E2%80%93 Participating wikis and test start date|20 Wikipedias]] to answer this question.
*[[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Usability improvements|Usability improvements]]: This project will make the mobile visual editor easier to use.  The goal is to let contributors stay focused on editing and to feel more confident in the editing tools.

=== Looking ahead ===

* '''Wikimania:'''  Several members of the Editing Team will be attending [[wmania:|Wikimania]] in August 2019.  They will lead a session about mobile editing in the [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/Visual editing on mobile: An accessible editor for all|Community Growth space]].  Talk to the team about how editing can be improved.
* '''Talk Pages:'''  In the coming months, the Editing Team will begin [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|improving talk pages]] and communication on the wikis.

=== Learning more ===
The [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|VisualEditor on mobile]] is a good place to learn more about the projects we are working on. The team wants to talk with you about anything related to editing.

== Update on the consultation about office actions ==

Hello all, 

Last month, the Wikimedia Foundation's Trust & Safety team [[:en:Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)/Archive_152#Announcement_of_forthcoming_temporary_and_partial_ban_tool_consultation|announced]] a future consultation about partial and/or temporary [[m:Special:MyLanguage/office actions|office actions]]. We want to let you know that the '''draft version''' of this consultation has now been [[:m:Office_actions/Community_consultation_on_partial_and_temporary_office_actions/draft|posted on Meta]]. 

This is a '''draft'''. It is not intended to be the consultation itself, which will be posted on Meta likely in early September. Please do not treat this draft as a consultation. Instead, we ask your assistance in forming the final language for the consultation.

For that end, we would like your input over the next couple of weeks about what questions the consultation should ask about partial and temporary Foundation office action bans and how it should be formatted. '''[[:m:Talk:Office_actions/Community_consultation_on_partial_and_temporary_office_actions/draft|Please post it on the draft talk page]]'''. Our goal is to provide space for the community to discuss all the aspects of these office actions that need to be discussed, and we want to ensure with your feedback that the consultation is presented in the best way to encourage frank and constructive conversation.

Please visit [[:m:Office_actions/Community_consultation_on_partial_and_temporary_office_actions/draft|the consultation draft on Meta-wiki]] and leave your comments on the draft’s talk page about what the consultation should look like and what questions it should ask. 

Thank you for your input! -- The [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Trust and Safety|Trust & Safety team]] 08:03, 16 ougùstùs 2019 (UTC)

== New tools and IP masking ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div class="plainlinks">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
Hey everyone,

The Wikimedia Foundation wants to work on two things that affect how we patrol changes and handle vandalism and harassment. We want to make the tools that are used to handle bad edits better. We also want to get better privacy for unregistered users so their IP addresses are no longer shown to everyone in the world. We would not hide IP addresses until we have better tools for patrolling.

We have an idea of what tools ''could'' be working better and how a more limited access to IP addresses would change things, but we need to hear from more wikis. You can read more about the project [[m:IP Editing: Privacy Enhancement and Abuse Mitigation|on Meta]] and [[m:Talk:IP Editing: Privacy Enhancement and Abuse Mitigation|post comments and feedback]]. Now is when we need to hear from you to be able to give you better tools to handle vandalism, spam and harassment.

You can post in your language if you can't write in English.

== The consultation on partial and temporary Foundation bans just started ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
<div class="plainlinks">
Hello, 

In a [[:en:Wikipedia:Community_response_to_the_Wikimedia_Foundation%27s_ban_of_Fram/Official_statements#Board_statement|recent statement]], the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees [[:en:Wikipedia:Community_response_to_the_Wikimedia_Foundation%27s_ban_of_Fram/Official_statements#Board_statement|requested that staff hold a consultation]] to "re-evaluat[e] or add community input to the two new office action policy tools (temporary and partial Foundation bans)".

Accordingly, the Foundation's Trust & Safety team invites all Wikimedians [[:m:Office actions/Community consultation on partial and temporary office actions/09 2019|to join this consultation and give their feedback]] from 30 September to 30 October. 

How can you help?

* Suggest how partial and temporary Foundation bans should be used, if they should (eg: On all projects, or only on a subset);

* Give ideas about how partial and temporary Foundation bans should ideally implemented, if they should be; and/or

* Propose changes to the existing Office Actions policy on partial and temporary bans.

We offer our thanks in advance for your contributions, and we hope to get as much input as possible from community members during this consultation!

== Feedback wanted on Desktop Improvements project ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
{{Int:Please-translate}}

{{int:Hello}}. The Readers Web team at the WMF will work on some [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements|improvements to the desktop interface]] over the next couple of years. The goal is to increase usability without removing any functionality. We have been inspired by changes made by volunteers, but that currently only exist as local gadgets and user scripts, prototypes, and volunteer-led skins. We would like to begin the process of bringing some of these changes into the default experience on all Wikimedia projects. 

We are currently in the research stage of this project and are looking for ideas for improvements, as well as feedback on our current ideas and mockups.  So far, we have performed interviews with community members at Wikimania. We have gathered lists of previous volunteer and WMF work in this area. We are examining possible technical approaches for such changes.  

We would like individual feedback on the following:

* Identifying focus areas for the project we have not yet discovered
* Expanding the list of existing gadgets and user scripts that are related to providing a better desktop experience. If you can think of some of these from your wiki, please let us know
* Feedback on the ideas and mockups we have collected so far

We would also like to gather a list of wikis that would be interested in being test wikis for this project - these wikis would be the first to receive the updates once we’re ready to start building. 

When giving feedback, please consider the following goals of the project:

* Make it easier for readers to focus on the content
* Provide easier access to everyday actions (e.g. search, language switching, editing)
* Put things in logical and useful places
* Increase consistency in the interface with other platforms - mobile web and the apps
* Eliminate clutter
* Plan for future growth

As well as the following constraints:

* Not touching the content - no work will be done in terms of styling templates or to the structure of page contents themselves
* Not removing any functionality - things might move around, but all navigational items and other functionality currently available by default will remain
* No drastic changes to the layout - we're taking an evolutionary approach to the changes and want the site to continue feeling familiar to readers and editors

Please give all feedback (in any language) at [[mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements|mw:Talk:Reading/Web/Desktop Improvements]] 

After this round of feedback, we plan on building a prototype of suggested changes based on the feedback we receive. You’ll hear from us again asking for feedback on this prototype.

== Beta feature "Reference Previews" ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"> 
A new beta feature will soon be deployed to your wiki: [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/ReferencePreviews|Reference Previews]]. As you might guess from the name, this feature gives you a preview of references in the article text. That means, you can look up a reference without jumping down to the bottom of the page.

Reference Previews have already been a beta feature on German and Arabic Wikipedia since April. Now they will become available on more wikis. Deployment is planned for October 24. More information can be found [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/ReferencePreviews|on the project page]].

As always, feedback is highly appreciated. If you want to test Reference Previews, please activate the beta feature in your [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|user preferences]] and let us know what you think. The best place for feedback is the [[mw:Help talk:Reference Previews|central talk page]]. We hope the feature will serve you well in your work. Thank you from Wikimedia Deutschland's [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes|Technical Wishes project]].

== Editing News #2 – Mobile editing and talk pages ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
<em>[[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter/2019/October|Read this in another language]] • [[m:VisualEditor/Newsletter|Subscription list for this multilingual newsletter]]</em>

Inside this newsletter, the [[mw:Editing|Editing team]] talks about their work on the [[mw:Mobile visual editor|mobile visual editor]], on [[mw:Talk pages project|the new talk pages project]], and at [[wikimania:|Wikimania 2019]].

=== Help ===
<strong>What talk page interactions do you remember?</strong> Is it a story about how someone helped you to learn something new? Is it a story about how someone helped you get involved in a group? Something else?  Whatever your story is, we want to hear it!  

Please tell us a story about how you used a talk page.  <mark>Please share a link to a memorable discussion, or describe it on the <strong>[[mw:Topic:V8d91yh8gcg404dj|talk page for this project]]</strong>.</mark>  The team wants your examples.  These examples will help everyone develop a shared understanding of what this project should support and encourage.

=== Talk pages project ===
The [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019|Talk Pages Consultation]] was a global consultation to define better tools for wiki communication. From February through June 2019, more than 500 volunteers on 20 wikis, across 15 languages and multiple projects, came together with members of the Foundation to create a product direction for a set of discussion tools.  The [[mw:Talk pages consultation 2019/Phase 2 report|Phase 2 Report]] of the Talk Page Consultation was published in August. It summarizes the product direction the team has started to work on, which you can read more about here: [[mw:Talk pages project|Talk Page Project project page]]. 

The team needs and wants your help at this early stage.  They are starting to develop the first idea. Please add your name to the [[mw:Talk pages project#Getting involved|<strong>"Getting involved"</strong>]] section of the project page, if you would like to hear about opportunities to participate.

=== Mobile visual editor ===
The Editing team is trying to make it simpler to edit on mobile devices.  The team is changing the [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile|visual editor on mobile]]. If you have something to say about editing on a mobile device, please leave a message at [[mw:Talk:VisualEditor on mobile|Talk:VisualEditor on mobile]].

[[File:Edit Cards-before-v3-comparison.png|thumb|486x486px|What happens when you click on a link.  The new Edit Card is bigger and has more options for editing links.]]

* On 3 September, the Editing team released [[:File:Edit Cards comparison v2 and v3.png|version 3 of Edit Cards]]. Anyone could use the new version in the mobile visual editor.
* There is an [[:File:Edit Cards comparison v2 and v3.png|updated design]] on the Edit Card for adding and modifying links.  There is also a new, [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Edit cards#2 September 2019 - v3 deployment timing|combined workflow for editing a link's display text and target]].
* Feedback: You can try the new Edit Cards by opening the mobile visual editor on a smartphone. Please post your feedback on the [[:mw:Topic:V5rg0cqmikpubmjj|Edit cards talk page]].

==== [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Toolbar refresh|Toolbar]] ====

* In September, the Editing team updated the mobile visual editor's editing toolbar.  Anyone could see these changes in the mobile visual editor.
** <em>One toolbar:</em> All of the editing tools are located in one toolbar.  Previously, the toolbar changed when you clicked on different things.
**<em>New navigation:</em> The buttons for moving forward and backward in the edit flow have changed.
**<em>Seamless switching:</em> an [[phab:T228159|improved workflow]] for switching between the visual and wikitext modes.
* Feedback: You can try the refreshed toolbar by opening the mobile VisualEditor on a smartphone. Please post your feedback on the [[mw:Topic:V79x6zm8n6i4nb56|Toolbar feedback talk page]].

=== Wikimania ===
The Editing Team attended [[wmania:2019:Program|Wikimania 2019]] in Sweden.  They led a session on [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/Visual editing on mobile: An accessible editor for all|the mobile visual editor]] and a session on [[wmania:2019:Community Growth/After Flow: A new direction for improving talk pages|the new talk pages project]].  They tested [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Toolbar refresh#v1 prototype|two]] new [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Edit cards#v3 prototype|features]] in the mobile visual editor with contributors.  You can read more about what the team did and learned in [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile#Wikimania Stockholm: Overview|the team's report on Wikimania 2019]].

=== Looking ahead ===

* <strong>Talk Pages Project:</strong> The team is thinking about the first set of proposed changes.  The team will be working with a few communities to pilot those changes. The best way to stay informed is by adding your username to the list on the project page: [[mw:Talk pages project#Getting involved|<strong>Getting involved</strong>]].
* <strong>Testing the mobile visual editor as the default:</strong>  The Editing team plans to post results before the end of the calendar year. The best way to stay informed is by adding the project page to your watchlist: [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/VE mobile default|<strong>VisualEditor as mobile default project page</strong>]].
* <strong>Measuring the impact of Edit Cards:</strong>  This study asks whether the project helped editors add links and citations.  The Editing team hopes to share results in November.  The best way to stay informed is by adding the project page to your watchlist: [[mw:VisualEditor on mobile/Edit cards|<strong>Edit Cards project page</strong>]].

== Additional interface for edit conflicts on talk pages ==

''Sorry, for writing this text in English. If you could help to translate it, it would be appreciated.'' 

You might know the new interface for edit conflicts (currently a beta feature). Now, Wikimedia Germany is designing an additional interface to solve edit conflicts on talk pages. This interface is shown to you when you write on a discussion page and another person writes a discussion post in the same line and saves it before you do. With this additional editing conflict interface you can adjust the order of the comments and edit your comment.  We are inviting everyone to have a look at [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes/Edit Conflicts#Edit conflicts on talk pages|the planned feature]]. Let us know what you think on our [[mw:Help talk:Two Column Edit Conflict View|central feedback page]]! -- For the Technical Wishes Team: [[m:User:Max Klemm (WMDE)|Max Klemm (WMDE)]] 14:15, 26 febrüari 2020 (UTC)

== Annual contest Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos ==

[[File:WPWP logo 1.png|150px|right|Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos (WPWP)]]
This is to invite you to join the Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos (WPWP) campaign to help improve Wikipedia articles with photos and win prizes. The campaign starts today 1st July 2020 and closes 31st August 2020.

The campaign primarily aims at using images from Wikimedia Commons on Wikipedia articles that are lacking images. Participants will choose among Wikipedia pages without photo images, then add a suitable file from among the many thousands of photos in the Wikimedia Commons, especially those uploaded from thematic contests (Wiki Loves Africa, Wiki Loves Earth, Wiki Loves Folklore, etc.) over the years.

Please visit the '''[[m:Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos|campaign page]]''' to learn more about the WPWP Campaign.

With kind regards,

Thank you,

Seven years ago this month, the [[mw:Editing team|Editing team]] offered the visual editor to most Wikipedia editors.  Since then, editors have achieved many milestones:

* More than <strong>50 million edits</strong> have been made using the visual editor on desktop.
* More than <strong>2 million new articles</strong> have been created in the visual editor. More than 600,000 of these new articles were created during 2019.
* The visual editor is <strong>increasingly popular</strong>.  The proportion of all edits made using the visual editor has increased every year since its introduction.
* In 2019, <strong>35% of the edits by newcomers</strong> (logged-in editors with ≤99 edits) used the visual editor. This percentage has <strong>increased every year</strong>.
* Almost <strong>5 million edits on the mobile site</strong> have been made with the visual editor.  Most of these edits have been made since the Editing team started improving the [[mw:Mobile visual editor|mobile visual editor]] in 2018.
* On 17 November 2019, the [https://discuss-space.wmflabs.org/t/first-edit-made-to-wikipedia-from-outer-space/2254 <strong>first edit from outer space</strong>] was made in the mobile visual editor. 🚀 👩‍🚀

== Announcing a new wiki project! Welcome, Abstract Wikipedia ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

Hi all,

It is my honor to introduce Abstract Wikipedia, a new project that has been unanimously approved by the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. Abstract Wikipedia proposes a new way to generate baseline encyclopedic content in a multilingual fashion, allowing more contributors and more readers to share more knowledge in more languages. It is an approach that aims to make cross-lingual cooperation easier on our projects, increase the sustainability of our movement through expanding access to participation, improve the user experience for readers of all languages, and innovate in free knowledge by connecting some of the strengths of our movement to create something new.

This is our first new project in over seven years. Abstract Wikipedia was submitted as a project proposal by Denny Vrandečić in May 2020 <ref>[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Abstract Wikipedia|Abstract Wikipedia]]</ref> after years of preparation and research, leading to a detailed plan and lively discussions in the Wikimedia communities. We know that the energy and the creativity of the community often runs up against language barriers, and information that is available in one language may not make it to other language Wikipedias. Abstract Wikipedia intends to look and feel like a Wikipedia, but build on the powerful, language-independent conceptual models of Wikidata, with the goal of letting volunteers create and maintain Wikipedia articles across our polyglot Wikimedia world.

The project will allow volunteers to assemble the fundamentals of an article using words and entities from Wikidata. Because Wikidata uses conceptual models that are meant to be universal across languages, it should be possible to use and extend these building blocks of knowledge to create models for articles that also have universal value. Using code, volunteers will be able to translate these abstract “articles” into their own languages. If successful, this could eventually allow everyone to read about any topic in Wikidata in their own language.

As you can imagine, this work will require a lot of software development, and a lot of cooperation among Wikimedians. In order to make this effort possible, Denny will join the Foundation as a staff member in July and lead this initiative. You may know Denny as the creator of Wikidata, a long-time community member, a former staff member at Wikimedia Deutschland, and a former Trustee at the Wikimedia Foundation <ref>[[m:User:Denny|User:Denny]]</ref>. We are very excited that Denny will bring his skills and expertise to work on this project alongside the Foundation’s product, technology, and community liaison teams.

It is important to acknowledge that this is an experimental project, and that every Wikipedia community has different needs. This project may offer some communities great advantages. Other communities may engage less. Every language Wikipedia community will be free to choose and moderate whether or how they would use content from this project.

We are excited that this new wiki-project has the possibility to advance knowledge equity through increased access to knowledge. It also invites us to consider and engage with critical questions about how and by whom knowledge is constructed. We look forward to working in cooperation with the communities to think through these important questions.

There is much to do as we begin designing a plan for Abstract Wikipedia in close collaboration with our communities. I encourage you to get involved by going to the project page and joining the new mailing list <ref>[[mail:abstract-wikipedia|Abstract Wikipedia mailing list]]</ref>. We recognize that Abstract Wikipedia is ambitious, but we also recognize its potential. We invite you all to join us on a new, unexplored path.

Yours,

Katherine Maher (Executive Director, Wikimedia Foundation)

== The Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC): we want to hear from you. ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">

''{{int:Hello}}. Apologies that you may not be reading this message in your native language: translations of the following message may be available on [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Message to small and medium sized wikis|Meta]]. {{int:please-translate}}. {{Int:Feedback-thanks-title}}''<br>

At times, our contributor communities and projects have suffered from a lack of guidelines that can help us create an environment where free knowledge can be shared safely without fear. 
There has been talk about the need for a global set of conduct rules in different communities over time. 

Recently, the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees announced a [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia_Foundation_Board_noticeboard/May_2020_-_Board_of_Trustees_on_Healthy_Community_Culture,_Inclusivity,_and_Safe_Spaces|Community Culture Statement]], asking for new standards to address harassment and promote inclusivity across projects.

The universal code of conduct will be a binding minimum set of standards across all Wikimedia projects, and will apply to all of us, staff and volunteers alike, all around the globe. It is of great importance that we all participate in expressing our opinions and thoughts about UCoC and its values. We should think about what we want it to cover or include and what it shouldn’t include, and how it may create difficulties or help our groups. 

This is the time to talk about it. Before starting drafting the code of conduct, we would like to hear from you and to solicit the opinions and feedback of your colleagues. 
In order for your voice to be heard, we encourage and invite you to read more about [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal_Code_of_Conduct|the universal code of conduct (UCoC)]] and then write down your opinions or feedback [[:m:Talk:Universal_Code_of_Conduct|on the discussion page]].  

To reduce language barriers during the process, you are welcome to translate [https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-Universal+Code+of+Conduct&language=en&action=page&filter= the universal code of conduct main page] from English into your respective local language. You and your community may choose to provide your opinions/feedback using your local languages. 

Thanks in advance for your attention and contributions, [[:m:Talk:Trust_and_Safety|The Trust and Safety team at Wikimedia Foundation]] 16:42, 22 yüli 2020 (UTC)

== Technical Wishes: FileExporter and FileImporter become default features on all Wikis ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
The [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|FileExporter and FileImporter]] will become a default features on all wikis until August 7, 2020. They are planned to help you to move files from your local wiki to Wikimedia Commons easier while keeping all original file information (Description, Source, Date, Author, View History) intact. Additionally, the move is documented in the files view history. 
How does it work? 

Step 1: If you are an auto-confirmed user, you will see a link "Move file to Wikimedia Commons" on the local file page. 

Step 2: When you click on this link, the FileImporter checks if the file can in fact be moved to Wikimedia Commons. These checks are performed based on the wiki's [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons/Configuration_file_documentation|configuration file]] which is created and maintained by each local wiki community. 

Step 3: If the file is compatible with Wikimedia Commons, you will be taken to an import page, at which you can update or add information regarding the file, such as the description. You can also add the 'Now Commons' template to the file on the local wiki by clicking the corresponding check box in the import form. Admins can delete the file from the local wiki by enabling the corresponding checkbox. By clicking on the 'Import' button at the end of the page, the file is imported to Wikimedia Commons. 

If you want to know more about the [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Move_files_to_Commons|FileImporter extension]] or the [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes|Technical Wishes Project]], follow the links. --For the Technical Wishes Team: </div>[[User:Max Klemm (WMDE)|Max Klemm (WMDE)]] 09:14, 6 ougùstùs 2020 (UTC)

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] will be testing its secondary data centre.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster. To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to do a planned test. This test will show if they can reliably switch from one data centre to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic to the secondary data centre on '''Tuesday, September 1st 2020'''.

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop while the switch is made.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for up to an hour on Tuesday, September 1st. The test will start at [https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20200901T14 14:00 UTC] (15:00 BST, 16:00 CEST, 10:00 EDT, 19:30 IST, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Wednesday September 2).
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the week of September 1st, 2020.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch Datacenter#Schedule for 2018 switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this.  '''Please share this information with your community.'''

== Call for feedback about Wikimedia Foundation Bylaws changes and Board candidate rubric ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
{{int:Hello}}. Apologies if you are not reading this message in your native language. {{Int:Please-translate}}.

Today the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees starts two calls for feedback. One is about changes to the Bylaws mainly to increase the Board size from 10 to 16 members. The other one is about a trustee candidate rubric to introduce new, more effective ways to evaluate new Board candidates. The Board welcomes your comments through 26 October. For more details, [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation Board noticeboard/October 2020 - Call for feedback about Bylaws changes and Board candidate rubric|check the full announcement]].

[[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Tech/Server switch 2020|Read this message in another language]]  •  [https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-Tech%2FServer+switch+2020&language=&action=page&filter= {{int:please-translate}}]

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] tests the switch between its first and secondary data centers.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster. To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to do a planned test. This test will show if they can reliably switch from one data centre to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. 

They will switch all traffic back to the primary data center on '''Tuesday, October 27 2020'''.

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop while the switch is made.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for up to an hour on Tuesday, October 27. The test will start at [https://zonestamp.toolforge.org/1603807200 14:00 UTC] (14:00 WET, 15:00 CET, 10:00 EDT, 19:30 IST, 07:00 PDT, 23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 03:00 NZDT on Wednesday October 28).
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the week of October 26, 2020.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch_Datacenter#Schedule_for_2020_switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this. A banner will be displayed on all wikis 30 minutes before this operation happens.

== Admin on the Papiamentu Wikipedia? ==
Hi,

Some people would like to 'revive' the Papiamentu Wikipedia, but there is some backlogged maintenance work that need to be done first. I've been an admin on the Dutch Wikipedia for 14 years and from that experience offer to help out, by doing some maintenance work but also by showing other new admins, that hopefully step forward soon, how the Mediawiki extensions work, how to keep a wiki clean, and how to build a community. 

For this it would be handy if I was granted admin rights on this wiki: it is in no way my intention to be admin for life, since I do not speak the language, but I am more than willing to help set up this new community. I'd like to apply for adminship on meta over ~10 days, if everyone is okay with this at least. Please let me know if you have any questions, either here or by email.

==Curaçao photos==
My apologies as I am not fluent in Papiamentu. I would just like to let people know there is a [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:History_of_Cura%C3%A7ao big collection] of images from Curaçao's history. ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:People_of_Cura%C3%A7ao Click here] for photos of people; there are some color photos from the 1960s as well.) Many of them are not used and I imagine many people interested in this Wikipedia would like to use them if they don't already know about them.

== Adjustments for this wiki ==
Hi,

I've put in a request for a patrolling marker, so we can check off patrolled edits (for instance in the recent changes). I need community support for this, so please let me know if you support this feature, either here below, or on [[phabricator:T268924]]. (You can log in and comment with your Wikimedia-account)

I would also like to propose to ask for a 'new section' tab to be added for talk pages and the Portal di komunidat. This tab is on the right, between 'edit' and history, so you don't have to edit the complete page if you want to create a new section (like [[:en:Wikipedia:Help_desk|here on en:]]). 
Please also for this speak your mind whether you would support such a change. 

(courtesy ping @[[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]], @[[User:YAniceta|YAniceta]], @[[User:Dwerg85|Dwerg85]])

Best, [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 10:17, 29 novèmber 2020 (UTC)
*I've created a public [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox-page]], feel free (please!) to translate the text to Papiamentu.
* It would be nice to fill [[Help:Kontenido]], since it is linked in the side-column. Any help is appreciated.
*I created the templates {{tl|See article}} and {{tl|See also}}, plus the page [[Help:Disambiguashon]] for explanation (feel free to translate, of course)
* For pages that need deletion, please use {{tl|Delete}}, and mention them on [[Wikipedia:Páginanan pa sea kitá]].

<br>

:These are all positive additions and improvements to the wiki. +1 support from me. --[[User:Dwerg85|Dwerg85]] ([[User talk:Dwerg85|talk]]) 23:01, 7 desèmber 2020 (UTC)
::Thanks Dwergje! Patrolling has been turned on this afternoon: you can now see the exclamation mark in the [[Special:RecentChanges|recent changes]], and a "mark as patrolled" button when you compare versions. On the Dutch Wikipedia we only use this for ip- or newbie edits, but off course this wiki can decide different. [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 21:00, 15 desèmber 2020 (UTC)

== Wikidata descriptions changes to be included more often in Recent Changes and Watchlist ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''Sorry for sending this message in English. Translations are available on [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Announcements/Announcement Wikidata descriptions in watchlist|this page]]. Feel free to translate it in more languages!''

As you may know, you can include changes coming from Wikidata in your Watchlist and Recent Changes ([[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-watchlist|in your preferences]]). Until now, this feature didn’t always include changes made on Wikidata descriptions due to the way Wikidata tracks the data used in a given article.

Starting on December 3rd, the Watchlist and Recent Changes will include changes on the descriptions of Wikidata Items that are used in the pages that you watch. This will only include descriptions in the language of your wiki to make sure that you’re only seeing changes that are relevant to your wiki.

This improvement was requested by many users from different projects. We hope that it can help you monitor the changes on Wikidata descriptions that affect your wiki and participate in the effort of improving the data quality on Wikidata for all Wikimedia wikis and beyond.

Note: if you didn’t use the Wikidata watchlist integration feature for a long time, feel free to give it another chance! The feature has been improved since the beginning and the content it displays is more precise and useful than at the beginning of the feature in 2015.

If you encounter any issue or want to provide feedback, feel free to use [[Phab:T191831|this Phabricator ticket]]. Thanks!
