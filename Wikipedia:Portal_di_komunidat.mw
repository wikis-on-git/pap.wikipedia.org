== Admin on the Papiamentu Wikipedia? ==
Hi,

Some people would like to 'revive' the Papiamentu Wikipedia, but there is some backlogged maintenance work that need to be done first. I've been an admin on the Dutch Wikipedia for 14 years and from that experience offer to help out, by doing some maintenance work but also by showing other new admins, that hopefully step forward soon, how the Mediawiki extensions work, how to keep a wiki clean, and how to build a community. 

For this it would be handy if I was granted admin rights on this wiki: it is in no way my intention to be admin for life, since I do not speak the language, but I am more than willing to help set up this new community. I'd like to apply for adminship on meta over ~10 days, if everyone is okay with this at least. Please let me know if you have any questions, either here or by email.

:I am very grateful that you want to help out with Wikipedia Papiamentu and would like very much if you could join as an administrator temporarily. [[User:YAniceta|YAniceta]] ([[User talk:YAniceta|talk]]) 13:37, 18 novèmber 2020 (UTC)

==Curaçao photos==
My apologies as I am not fluent in Papiamentu. I would just like to let people know there is a [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:History_of_Cura%C3%A7ao big collection] of images from Curaçao's history. ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:People_of_Cura%C3%A7ao Click here] for photos of people; there are some color photos from the 1960s as well.) Many of them are not used and I imagine many people interested in this Wikipedia would like to use them if they don't already know about them.

== Adjustments for this wiki ==
Hi,

I've put in a request for a patrolling marker, so we can check off patrolled edits (for instance in the recent changes). I need community support for this, so please let me know if you support this feature, either here below, or on [[phabricator:T268924]]. (You can log in and comment with your Wikimedia-account)

I would also like to propose to ask for a 'new section' tab to be added for talk pages and the Portal di komunidat. This tab is on the right, between 'edit' and history, so you don't have to edit the complete page if you want to create a new section (like [[:en:Wikipedia:Help_desk|here on en:]]). 
Please also for this speak your mind whether you would support such a change. 

(courtesy ping @[[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]], @[[User:YAniceta|YAniceta]], @[[User:Dwerg85|Dwerg85]])

Best, [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 10:17, 29 novèmber 2020 (UTC)
*I've created a public [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox-page]], feel free (please!) to translate the text to Papiamentu.
* It would be nice to fill [[Help:Kontenido]], since it is linked in the side-column. Any help is appreciated.
*I created the templates {{tl|See article}} and {{tl|See also}}, plus the page [[Help:Disambiguashon]] for explanation (feel free to translate, of course)
* For pages that need deletion, please use {{tl|Delete}}, and mention them on [[Wikipedia:Páginanan pa sea kitá]].

<br>

:These are all positive additions and improvements to the wiki. +1 support from me. --[[User:Dwerg85|Dwerg85]] ([[User talk:Dwerg85|talk]]) 23:01, 7 desèmber 2020 (UTC)
::Thanks Dwergje! Patrolling has been turned on this afternoon: you can now see the exclamation mark in the [[Special:RecentChanges|recent changes]], and a "mark as patrolled" button when you compare versions. On the Dutch Wikipedia we only use this for ip- or newbie edits, but off course this wiki can decide different. [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 21:00, 15 desèmber 2020 (UTC)

== Wikidata descriptions changes to be included more often in Recent Changes and Watchlist ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">
''Sorry for sending this message in English. Translations are available on [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Announcements/Announcement Wikidata descriptions in watchlist|this page]]. Feel free to translate it in more languages!''

As you may know, you can include changes coming from Wikidata in your Watchlist and Recent Changes ([[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-watchlist|in your preferences]]). Until now, this feature didn’t always include changes made on Wikidata descriptions due to the way Wikidata tracks the data used in a given article.

Starting on December 3rd, the Watchlist and Recent Changes will include changes on the descriptions of Wikidata Items that are used in the pages that you watch. This will only include descriptions in the language of your wiki to make sure that you’re only seeing changes that are relevant to your wiki.

This improvement was requested by many users from different projects. We hope that it can help you monitor the changes on Wikidata descriptions that affect your wiki and participate in the effort of improving the data quality on Wikidata for all Wikimedia wikis and beyond.

Note: if you didn’t use the Wikidata watchlist integration feature for a long time, feel free to give it another chance! The feature has been improved since the beginning and the content it displays is more precise and useful than at the beginning of the feature in 2015.

If you encounter any issue or want to provide feedback, feel free to use [[Phab:T191831|this Phabricator ticket]]. Thanks!

== Templates needed ==
Can someone give assistance to the Papiamento wikipedia community by creating for us the following templates: {{tl|commonscat}} and {{coor title dms}}? Your contribution is highly appreciated. Any questions please contact me. [[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]] ([[User talk:Caribiana|talk]]) 11:13, 25 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
:I planned for this week to check how far along we are with everything, so I'll add these two templates on my list! [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 20:52, 25 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
::Do we have a {{tl|welcome}} already? I see we were joined by several new users last week, it would be nice to be able to send them a welcome message, in Papiamentu off course! [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 20:59, 25 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
:::Thank you, Ciell! I will make an effort to create a welcome template. Still learning by trial and error!!! Today I tried to use this [[Template:Infobox stadion]], but it does not work. Under special pages there is a list of unused templates that perhaps also need reviewing.[[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]] ([[User talk:Caribiana|talk]]) 22:54, 25 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
::::More complicated templates, like infoboxes, need a background with [[:en:Lua (programming language)]] to make information visible - that looks like the case with this one. It may be better to find a simpler template on another wiki to copy the code from. If I recall correctly, also [[User:YAniceta|YAniceta]] does not know Lua, and I know very little people that can really work with this code. [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 06:39, 26 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
: I did a quick move of {{tl|Commonscat}} for you. Here is an example:
{{Commonscat|Example images}}

: Please check the language, I have a bit of an ''atraso lingwístiko'' in Papiamentu. There are some artistic choices to be made regarding the location of links to the sister projects, and these require Admin privileges as well. Coor title dms also requires some artistic choices and admin access. So I left that to Ciell. ;) --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|talk]]) 15:25, 27 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
::Hi [[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]], masha danki!. Great input for the Papiamentu wikipedia to keep moving ahead. I made a minor adjustment to the template text. Most appreciated was that the "template" is identical to the Dutch version. This saves energy and time when translating articles from NL to PAP. Saludos!! [[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]] ([[User talk:Caribiana|talk]]) 18:54, 28 yanüari 2021 (UTC)
::: You're welcome! I have also had a look at {{tl|Coor title dms}} but I was a bit overwhelmed with options. I think it might be better to start afresh instead of copying the dutch version, because that one is rather complicated. Also, could you perhaps help me translate the terms 'oosterlengte', 'westerlengte', 'noorderbreedte' and 'zuiderbreedte'? And finally: how would one write the following coordinate (that of Willemstad): "12° 6′ NB, 68° 56′ WL" is what is written in Dutch, how would you translate the NB and WL? Is the notation somehow different? I would expect not, but you never know... --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|talk]]) 21:35, 28 yanüari 2021 (UTC)

== Admin rights on this wiki ==

Hi all,

My admin rights will expire in three days, on the 20th of February. Luckily, [[User:Caribiana|Caribeana]] and [[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] are willing to step forward and take up adminship on this wiki: they both speak Papiamentu and have a background in writing wiki articles, or development. I think they would make a great team, as they do already for the maintenance of this wiki!

I'd like to keep my rights for another 3 month so I can show them the ropes and help solve new problems they may encounter. For this, I again need the communities' support. So for you the question:<br>
''Can I get your support for another three months as an admin here?''

Thanks! [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|talk]]) 11:05, 17 febrüari 2021 (UTC)
: '''Yes'''. I wholeheartedly support Ciells request for another three months. And indeed, I am willing to take on admin duties, if there are no objections. I am happy that Ciell wants to back us up as we familiarize ourselves with this new role (or at least, new to me). --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|talk]]) 11:41, 17 febrüari 2021 (UTC)

== Universal Code of Conduct – 2021 consultations ==

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
=== Universal Code of Conduct Phase 2 ===

{{int:please-translate}}

The [[:wmf:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct|'''Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC)''']] provides a universal baseline of acceptable behavior for the entire Wikimedia movement and all its projects. The project is currently in Phase 2, outlining clear enforcement pathways. You can read more about the whole project on its [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct|'''project page''']].

==== Drafting Committee: Call for applications ====

The Wikimedia Foundation is recruiting volunteers to join a committee to draft how to make the code enforceable. Volunteers on the committee will commit between 2 and 6 hours per week from late April through July and again in October and November. It is important that the committee be diverse and inclusive, and have a range of experiences, including both experienced users and newcomers, and those who have received or responded to, as well as those who have been falsely accused of harassment.

To apply and learn more about the process, see [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee|Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee]].

==== 2021 community consultations: Notice and call for volunteers / translators ====

From 5 April – 5 May 2021 there will be conversations on many Wikimedia projects about how to enforce the UCoC. We are looking for volunteers to translate key material, as well as to help host consultations on their own languages or projects using suggested [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations/Discussion|key questions]]. If you are interested in volunteering for either of these roles, please [[:m:Talk:Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations|contact us]] in whatever language you are most comfortable.

To learn more about this work and other conversations taking place, see [[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations|Universal Code of Conduct/2021 consultations]].

== Line numbering coming soon to all wikis ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">  

[[File:Technical_Wishes_–_Line_numbering_-_2010_wikitext_editor.png|thumb|Example]]
From April 15, you can enable line numbering in some wikitext editors - for now in the template namespace, coming to more namespaces soon. This will make it easier to detect line breaks and to refer to a particular line in discussions. These numbers will be shown if you enable the syntax highlighting feature ([[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:CodeMirror|CodeMirror extension]]), which is supported in the [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Extension:WikiEditor|2010]] and [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/2017 wikitext editor|2017]] wikitext editors. 

More information can be found on [[m:WMDE Technical Wishes/Line Numbering|this project page]]. Everyone is invited to test the feature, and to give feedback [[m:talk:WMDE Technical Wishes/Line Numbering|on this talk page]].

== Suggested Values ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr">  

From April 29, it will be possible to suggest values for parameters in templates. Suggested values can be added to [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:TemplateData|TemplateData]] and will then be shown as a drop-down list in [[mw:Special:MyLanguage/Help:VisualEditor/User guide|VisualEditor]]. This allows template users to quickly select an appropriate value. This way, it prevents potential errors and reduces the effort needed to fill the template with values. It will still be possible to fill in values other than the suggested ones.

More information, including the supported parameter types and how to create suggested values: [[mw:Help:TemplateData#suggestedvalues|[1]]] [[m:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Suggested_values_for_template_parameters|[2]]]. Everyone is invited to test the feature, and to give feedback [[m:Talk:WMDE Technical Wishes/Suggested values for template parameters|on this talk page]].

== [[Wikipedia:Artíkulonan importante]] ==

Would you like to write an article on the Papiamentu Wikipedia, but aren't you sure about the topic? This '''[[Wikipedia:Artíkulonan importante|list]]''' has a lot of ideas on articles we're still missing! [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|diskushon]]) 22:15, 24 aprel 2021 (UTC)

== Rekisitonan ku tur artíkulo mester ta kumpli kuné ==

E kriterionan no ta e úniko base pa determiná si un artikulo ta adekuá i kla pa publiká.  
E prinsipio di sano huisio ta konta i lo guia nos.

Tur artíkulo den e ensiklopedia mester:

* Tin ''un base''; esei ta deskribí un tópiko spesífiko. Un artíkulo den [[Wikipedia]] no ta un storia, argumento, alabansa òf propaganda komersial, sino ta deskribí e tópiko den un manera neutral i konkreto. Si tin mas ku un solo posishon establesí, ta splika konsiso kiko ta esei i kua gruponan ta ligá na kua respektivo deklarashonnan ètsétera.

* Tin un ''introdukshon'' ku ta menshoná breve e tema i ta formula konsiso e pakiko e tópiko ta ensiklopédiko. E promé frase ta kontené e '''titulo di artikel''' ku lèter diki.

* Ta un ''distribushon lógiko den suptemanan''. Den kaso di un artikulo biografiko e órden kronológiko ta bisto, por ehempel.

* Ta identifiká ''artikulo tradusí'' for di un Wikipedia di otro idioma. E shablon {{tl|Tradukshon for di otro Wikipedia}} ta rekerí esaki.

* Ta basá riba ''fuente existente'' i ta menshoná esei. Un fuente no mester ta ''online'', tambe e por un buki òf dokumento skirbí. Menshoná e URL den kaso e fuente ta disponibel online. Ta obligatorio pa tin un mínimo di un (1) fuente, pero nos ta preferá ku tur deklarashon ta karga un fuente.

* Tin ''suptemanan stándart'' manera "Linknan eksterno", "Mira tambe", i otro. Usa nan kaminda ta posibel.

* Tin un ''mínimo di algun frase''. Un solo frase no ta sufisiente òf adekuá.

Artikulonan ki tin hopi eror, òf ki ta wordu skirbi den idioma kompletamente robes (ingles, hulandes, òf un tradukshon inlegibel òf inkomprensibel òf ta traha mediante un kòmpiuter) nos lo mester kita.

== Request for your feedback on improving the Content Translation tool for Papiamento Wikipedia ==

{{Int:Hello}} Papiamento Wikipedians!

Apologies as this message is not in your native language, {{Int:Please-translate}}.

The WMF language team is reaching out to your community, the Papiamento Wikipedia, about the [https://pap.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:ContentTranslation&campaign=contributionsmenu&to=pap#draft Content translation tool]. 

We noticed that articles created with the Content Translation tool in your wiki are deleted more than in other Wikipedias. We say this because, from our statistics, 117 articles were added to Papiamento Wikipedia in 2020. Out of the above figure, only 1 of them was translated using the Content Translation tool; 2 of the articles added with Content translation were deleted. The deletion rate and the tool's low usage signals a problem or deficiencies that might be peculiar to Papiamento Wikipedia. 
The Content Translation tool can increase content creation in your Wikipedia. Also, it is an excellent way to efficiently introduce newcomers to adding content and expand on existing ones. 

So we, the WMF Language team will like to get answers from members of your community on the following questions:
* What deficiencies do articles created with the Content translation tool have that makes them not of good quality?
* What makes it challenging to use the tool to create content in your Wikipedia.
* How can this tool be improved to make it more user-friendly and efficient to add good quality content in your language Wikipedia? 

We believe that the answers to the above questions are good ways to get insight into improving the tool for your community and others. Please, feel free to provide us feedback in this thread or [mailto:uozurumba@wikimedia.org email us] your feedback using the title of this message as your subject.

Thank you so much, as we look forward to your participation.


[[User:UOzurumba (WMF)|UOzurumba (WMF)]] ([[User talk:UOzurumba (WMF)|diskushon]]) 19:50, 26 mei 2021 (UTC) On behalf of the WMF Language team.
: Thanks for getting in touch, [[User:UOzurumba (WMF)|UOzurumba]]. If there is anything that we can do ourselves to make the tool more useful, I'm all ears. Are there experiences with other small language Wikipedias about specific steps to take to make it more useful? --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|diskushon]]) 00:02, 27 mei 2021 (UTC)
::Hello [[User:UOzurumba (WMF)|UOzurumba (WMF)]], first of all: we did a clean up of non-Papiamentu/-o articles last year, since we were behind on maintenance. So in general you'll probably see a peak in the pages deleted for 2020. Then: no, the translation tool is not very good. The Papiamentu dictionary used is just about sufficient, but not high in quality. There is almost no online translation tool that supports translation into the Papiamentu/-o language afaik. [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|diskushon]]) 20:15, 30 mei 2021 (UTC)

:::Hi [[User:UOzurumba (WMF)|UOzurumba (WMF)]]!! In the past I have attempted to use the translator tool. My idea was that it would help me save time and I could create more output since I am a native speaker. However, no article was produced with automated translation due to its poor quality. Deficiencies concern mostly syntax and grammar. Also, too many word-to-word translations make no sense in the context of the text. The tool is indeed in need of revision. Furthermore, in order to improve it adequately I think it is important to assess who are the actual users of this tool. It is my impression that they are mostly non-Papiamento speakers. Presently I consider reliance on a correct translation the major challenge to creating content for our WP.[[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]] ([[User talk:Caribiana|diskushon]]) 23:43, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)

:::::Hello Everyone,
:::::Thank you so much for your valuable feedback; they are all noted, and we will keep in touch on improving the tool based on your inputs. Please, do not hesitate to provide still more information that will help us.

== Article placeholder with information from Wikidata ==

Hi all,

A user from the WGC group pointed me to the "article placeholder" extension from Wikidata.

On blank pages, this displays facts about the topic from Wikidata, and then invites people to start an article about the topic in their own language. [https://ht.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espesyal:AboutTopic/Q14384 Here is an example from the Haitian Creole Wikipedia].

I like the idea to turn this on for the Papiamentu Wikipedia, what do you think?

([[User:Caribiana]], [[User:Dwerg85]], [[User:Frank Geerlings]], [[User:YAniceta]], [[User:Grijz]])

Best, [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|diskushon]]) 19:30, 30 mei 2021 (UTC)

: I'm in '''support'''. I think it's an interesting feature that we should try out. I have no objections to there being a trial period of, say, a few months, but frankly I am also fine with just having it enabled indefinitely. Aside: I am a bit skeptical about this leading to more articles being created, but I think it's a useful addition for the reader that solves the problem of there still being a lot of articles missing. --[[User:Frank Geerlings|Frank Geerlings]] ([[User talk:Frank Geerlings|diskushon]]) 16:53, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)
::In general I support the proposal, however I do have reservations about what goals can and will be achieved. I favour the tool mostly to attract more traffic, and in particular from the Papiamento language communities, which up to now prefer the English WP by far. Red links will now supply some basic information from Wikidata, which I understood will remain static. In my humble opinion the extension on its own will not suffice to generate new article contributions and that further strengthening of our efforts to target potential editor groups amongst Papiamento speakers will be essential. Since other minority languages have implemented this tool maybe we can inquire what their findings are with its use. In any case, I strongly recommend that we formulate concrete goals and after a certain time frame review the project results. Also I have a question, can someone elaborate on what (technical, editorial or other) efforts/input is needed to implement/switch on (and later maintain) the "article placeholder extension"?

* Newer editors who had automatic ("default on") access to the Reply tool were [https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ more likely] to post a comment on a talk page.
* The comments that newer editors made with the Reply Tool were also [https://wikimedia-research.github.io/Reply-tools-analysis-2021/ less likely] to be reverted than the comments that newer editors made with page editing.

These results give the Editing team confidence that the tool is helpful.

<strong>Looking ahead</strong>

The team is planning to make the Reply tool available to everyone as an opt-out preference in the coming months.  This has already happened at the Arabic, Czech, and Hungarian Wikipedias.

The next step is to [[phab:T280599|resolve a technical challenge]]. Then, they will deploy the Reply tool first to the [[phab:T267379|Wikipedias that participated in the study]].  After that, they will deploy it, in stages, to the other Wikipedias and all WMF-hosted wikis.

You can turn on "{{int:discussiontools-preference-label}}" [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|in Beta Features]] now.  After you get the Reply tool, you can change your preferences at any time in [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-editing-discussion]].

== Server switch ==

<div class="plainlinks mw-content-ltr" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div class="plainlinks">

[[:m:Special:MyLanguage/Tech/Server switch 2020|Read this message in another language]]  •  [https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Translate&group=page-Tech%2FServer+switch+2020&language=&action=page&filter= {{int:please-translate}}]

The [[foundation:|Wikimedia Foundation]] tests the switch between its first and secondary data centers.  This will make sure that Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia wikis can stay online even after a disaster. To make sure everything is working, the Wikimedia Technology department needs to do a planned test. This test will show if they can reliably switch from one data centre to the other. It requires many teams to prepare for the test and to be available to fix any unexpected problems. <!--

 They will switch all traffic back to the primary data center on '''Tuesday, October 27 2020'''. -->

Unfortunately, because of some limitations in [[mw:Manual:What is MediaWiki?|MediaWiki]], all editing must stop while the switch is made.  We apologize for this disruption, and we are working to minimize it in the future. 

'''You will be able to read, but not edit, all wikis for a short period of time.'''

*You will not be able to edit for up to an hour on Tuesday, 29 June 2021. The test will start at [https://zonestamp.toolforge.org/1624975200 14:00 UTC] (07:00 PDT, 10:00 EDT, 15:00 WEST/BST, 16:00 CEST, 19:30 IST,  23:00 JST, and in New Zealand at 02:00 NZST on Wednesday 30 June).
*If you try to edit or save during these times, you will see an error message.  We hope that no edits will be lost during these minutes, but we can't guarantee it.  If you see the error message, then please wait until everything is back to normal.  Then you should be able to save your edit.  But, we recommend that you make a copy of your changes first, just in case.

''Other effects'':

*Background jobs will be slower and some may be dropped. Red links might not be updated as quickly as normal. If you create an article that is already linked somewhere else, the link will stay red longer than usual. Some long-running scripts will have to be stopped.
*There will be code freezes for the week of June 28.  Non-essential code deployments will not happen.

This project may be postponed if necessary.  You can [[wikitech:Switch_Datacenter#Schedule_for_2021_switch|read the schedule at wikitech.wikimedia.org]]. Any changes will be announced in the schedule.  There will be more notifications about this. A banner will be displayed on all wikis 30 minutes before this operation happens. '''Please share this information with your community.'''</div></div> [[user:SGrabarczuk (WMF)|SGrabarczuk (WMF)]] 01:19, 27 yüni 2021 (UTC)

== Admin confirmations for Frank Geerlings, Carbiana, Ciell ==

Hi all,

At the moment three of the admins on this project (out of a total of four) need their admin rights reconfirmed by the community. Per the [[:meta:Steward_requests/Permissions/Minimum_voting_requirements|rules on Meta]], we need 2-4 votes for another 6 month approval: 5 of more votes (and 2/3 in favor of the applicant) would mean they get permanent rights. So please let us know if you would be in favor of extending the admin rights for the three of us, no hard feelings if you think the should not be prolonged, but then a little explanation would be nice.

Thank you! [[User:Ciell|Ciell]] ([[User talk:Ciell|diskushon]]) 16:32, 8 ougùstùs 2021 (UTC)
