The Call for Feedback: Board of Trustees elections is now open and will close on 7 February 2022. 

With this Call for Feedback, the Movement Strategy and Governance team is taking a different approach. This approach incorporates community feedback from 2021. Instead of leading with proposals, the Call is framed around key questions from the Board of Trustees. The key questions came from the feedback about the 2021 Board of Trustees election. The intention is to inspire collective conversation and collaborative proposal development about these key questions.

[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees/Call for feedback: Board of Trustees elections|Join the conversation.]]

Best,

Hello everyone,

The Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees released a [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Wikimedia Foundation Board noticeboard/January 2022 - Board of Trustees on Community ratification of enforcement guidelines of UCoC|statement on the ratification process]] for the '''[[m:Universal Code of Conduct/Enforcement guidelines|Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) Enforcement Guidelines]]'''.

The [[m:Universal Code of Conduct|Universal Code of Conduct]] (UCoC) provides a baseline of acceptable behavior for the entire movement. The UCoC and the Enforcement Guidelines were written by [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Drafting committee|volunteer-staff drafting committees]] following community consultations.

The revised guidelines were published 24 January 2022 as a proposed way to apply the policy across the movement. There is a [[m:Universal Code of Conduct/Enforcement guidelines/Changes|list of changes made]] to the guidelines after the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Enforcement draft guidelines review|enforcement draft guidelines review]]. '''Comments about the guidelines can be shared [[m:Talk:Universal Code of Conduct/Enforcement guidelines|on the Enforcement Guidelines talk page on Meta-wiki]].'''

To help to understand the guidelines and process, the [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Movement Strategy and Governance|Movement Strategy and Governance]] (MSG) team will be hosting Conversation Hours on 4 February 2022 at 15:00 UTC, 25 February 2022 at 12:00 UTC, and 4 March 2022 at 15:00 UTC. '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Universal Code of Conduct/Conversations|Join the conversation hours to speak with the UCoC project team and drafting committee members about the updated guidelines and voting process]].'''

The [[m:Universal Code of Conduct/Project#Timeline|timeline is available on Meta-wiki]]. The voting period is March 7 to 21. All eligible voters will have an opportunity to support or oppose the adoption of the Enforcement guidelines, and share why. '''[[m:Universal Code of Conduct/Enforcement guidelines/Voting|See the voting information page for more details]].'''

Many participants from across the movement have provided valuable input in these ongoing conversations. The UCoC and MSG teams want to thank the Drafting Committee and the community members for their contributions to this process. 

Sincerely,

Movement Strategy and Governance<br/>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr">
<section begin="announcement-content" />Hello! 

The Movement Strategy and Governance team of the Wikimedia Foundation would like to invite you to the next event about "Regional and Thematic Hubs". The Wikimedia Movement is in the process of understanding what Regional and Thematic Hubs should be. Our workshop in November was a good start ([[m:Special:MyLanguage/Hubs/Documentation/27 November Workshop|read the report]]), but we're not finished yet. 

Over the last weeks we conducted about 16 interviews with groups working on establishing a Hub in their context ([[m:Special:MyLanguage/Hubs/Dialogue|see Hubs Dialogue]]). These interviews informed a report that will serve as a foundation for discussion on March 12. The report is planned to be published on March 9.

The event will take place on March 12, 13:00 to 16:00 UTC on Zoom. Interpretation will be provided in French, Spanish, Arabic, Russian, and Portuguese. Registration is open, and will close on March 10. Anyone interested in the topic is invited to join us. '''[[m:Special:MyLanguage/Hubs/Global Conversations March 12, 2022|More information on the event on Meta-wiki]]'''.
