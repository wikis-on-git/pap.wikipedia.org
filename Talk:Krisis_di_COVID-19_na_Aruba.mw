== Category level and similar pages ==

<s>I suggest including this page in the '''[[:Category:COVID-19]]''' along with similar pages for other locations: 
* [[Krisis di COVID-19 na KÃ²rsou]]
* [[Krisis di COVID-19 na Sint Maarten]]
rather than the higher level '''[[:Category:Malesa]]'''.  - [[User:Deborahjay|Deborahjay]] ([[User talk:Deborahjay|diskushon]]) 17:01, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)</s>

'''Edited to add''': Per further changes by [[User:Caribiana]], it seems I'm still inadequately familiar with the orthography of Aruba pages (c rather than k). I'll watch out for those and try to edit where those aren't involved. Hence my striking out my previous remark, above. - [[User:Deborahjay|Deborahjay]] ([[User talk:Deborahjay|diskushon]]) 17:06, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)
