== Category level and similar pages ==

<s>I suggest including this page in the '''[[:Category:COVID-19]]''' along with similar pages for other locations: 
* [[Krisis di COVID-19 na KÃ²rsou]]
* [[Krisis di COVID-19 na Sint Maarten]]
rather than the higher level '''[[:Category:Malesa]]'''.  - [[User:Deborahjay|Deborahjay]] ([[User talk:Deborahjay|diskushon]]) 17:01, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)</s>

'''Edited to add''': Per further changes by [[User:Caribiana]], it seems I'm still inadequately familiar with the orthography of Aruba pages (c rather than k). I'll watch out for those and try to edit where those aren't involved. Hence my striking out my previous remark, above. - [[User:Deborahjay|Deborahjay]] ([[User talk:Deborahjay|diskushon]]) 17:06, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)
:Hi [[User:Deborahjay|Deborahjay]], I started labelling (at random) the articles according to the version that is predominant in the text. The template "variante|c" or just "variante" is for Curacao/Bonaire and "variante|a" is for Aruba. Since there are words that are similar one cannot always discern the right version at a first glance. Most articles are a mix of both versions. Indeed, the Curacao version applies a more creolized spelling with the use of '''k''' instead of '''c''' and '''i''' instead of '''y'''; frequent use of accents and less use of capitalisation of letters amongst others. The Aruba version stays closer to the origin of the words and has many similarities with Spanish, English, Dutch or whatever language the word is derived from. Regretfully we are short of editors for both versions. Nonetheless, you are doing a great job and after whatever you have corrected I will try to follow up with spelling or other corrections if needed. The coming weeks I will however be less active due to travel. [[User:Caribiana|Caribiana]] ([[User talk:Caribiana|diskushon]]) 17:56, 31 mei 2021 (UTC)
